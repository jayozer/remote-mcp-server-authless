## üìù **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Backup Your Current Config**
```bash
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup
```

### 2. **Update Your Configuration**
```bash
# Option A: Edit manually
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Option B: Use the Python script below
```

### 3. **Python Script to Update Config**
```python
import json
import os

config_path = os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json')

# Read existing config
try:
    with open(config_path, 'r') as f:
        config = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    config = {"mcpServers": {}}

# Add the three MCP servers
config['mcpServers'].update({
    "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://remote-mcp-server-authless.jayozer.workers.dev/sse"]
    },
    "playwright": {
        "command": "npx", 
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://playwright-mcp-server.jayozer.workers.dev/sse"]
    },
    "browser-use": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://browser-use-mcp-server.jayozer.workers.dev/sse"]
    }
})

# Write updated config
with open(config_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(config, f, indent=2)

print("‚úÖ Claude Desktop configuration updated successfully!")
print("üîÑ Please restart Claude Desktop to apply changes.")
```

### 4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
- Close Claude Desktop completely
- Reopen Claude Desktop
- The new MCP servers should be available

## üåê **Server Health Checks**

You can verify all servers are running:

```bash
# Sequential Thinking
curl -s https://remote-mcp-server-authless.jayozer.workers.dev/health

# Playwright  
curl -s https://playwright-mcp-server.jayozer.workers.dev/health

# Browser-use
curl -s https://browser-use-mcp-server.jayozer.workers.dev/health
```

## üéØ **Advanced Usage Examples**

### Complex Reasoning with Sequential Thinking:
```
Use sequential thinking with 8 steps to evaluate the technical architecture choices for a new social media platform, considering scalability, security, and user experience.
```

### Multi-step Browser Automation with Playwright:
```
1. Navigate to github.com
2. Click the search button
3. Fill the search with "claude desktop"
4. Wait for results to load
5. Take a screenshot of the results
```

### Natural Language Browser Control with Browser-use:
```
With my OpenAI key sk-..., help me:
1. Go to my company's internal dashboard
2. Find the quarterly sales report
3. Download the latest version
4. Take a screenshot when done
```

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

1. **"MCP server not found"**
   - Ensure `mcp-remote` package is installed: `npm install -g mcp-remote`
   - Check Claude Desktop config syntax

2. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Verify server URLs are accessible
   - Check internet connection

3. **"Authentication failed" (Browser-use only)**
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is valid and starts with "sk-"
   - Check API key has sufficient credits

4. **"Session not found"**
   - Sessions auto-expire after 30-60 minutes
   - Start a new session by making a fresh request
